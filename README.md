# HelloWorld
This is my first GitHub project and I will surely learn how to code this year

I am a learner and I really aspire to be a computer scientis.
I want to add amazing things to the world of technology.
I really love things which are very organised but not on the cost of nature, it is something I want to surpass the science of as I want humans to really explore the universe and my be the most elegent thing that is created by the mankind.
I don't think we are destroying the nature, yes we are in a way but not how we are just going to eradacte everything.
I am a learner and I will surely seek the truth.
